Description: This package contains geospatial data on urban river spaces
    used in CRiSp and related packages. The dataset contains vector data
    of the city boundary, bounding box enclosing the city boundary,
    spatial networks (street centerlines, railway lines), the river
    (centerline and surface), buildings surrounding the river, as well as
    a digital elevation model. The current dataset contains the case of
    River Dâmbovița in Bucharest.
